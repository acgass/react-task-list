# Task List

This project is really just a way for me to learn react. I decided to make a task list because I could easily come up with features that were straightforward and not overwhelming

# Current Functionality

1. Add new Tasks
2. Delete Task
3. mark task as done or not done

# Upcoming functionality ( in no particular order)
- Add validation to check if task name is empty
- Rename a Task
- Add a new Task List
- Be able to Name a task list
- Save a Task List
- adding tests so I can learn Jest (also its just good practice)
# Known bugs: 
- When an item is deleted, completed attribute gets flipped on all items after it in the task list and the mark task as done no long works as expected
